 * 
 *  The values currently maintained in each node include:
 *    - value : This is the value of the node. 
 *    - height: Height of the node in the tree. A node's height is the maximum

 * 
 *  Additional candidate values that can be considered (but currently not 
 *  implemented):
 *    - size: # of nodes in a node's subtrees
 *    - bf  : the nodes's balance factor, e.g., {-1, 0, 1}

 *  Class 'LUC_AVLTree'
 *
 *  LUC_AVLTree class definition for constructing / accessing / modifying the 
 *  AVL tree. In order to provide a general purpose AVL tree, better error 
 *  handling should to be provided.
 *
 *  Notes:
 *   1. This AVL tree does not allow duplicates, if one is attempted to be 
 *      inserted, no action is taken by the method (though an error should be 
 *      thrown).
 *   2. If a deletion is attempted for a non-existent value, no action is taken
 *      (again, returning an error indicator and/or throwing an error would be 
 *      appropriate.
 *
 *  Public methods:
 *   void    removeAll()         - Remove all nodes of the tree (empties tree)
 *   boolean checkEmpty()        - Returns boolean value if tree is empty or not
 *   void    insert(int value)   - inserts 'value' into the tree
 *   void    delete(int value)   - removes 'value' from the tree
 *   String  preorderTraversal() - returns a preorder traversal of tree in a String

    /**
     *  Method deleteElement
     *
     *  deleteElement() is private method that uses recursion. It will delete 
     *  an element within the tree. It considers several scenarios on where the 
     *  element to delete is in the tree.
     *
     *  This includes the following scenarios of where the node to delete is 
     *  in the tree:
     *    1. leaf node - simpliest case, just return null (which removes node)
     *    2. interior node with only left subtree below it (node gets replaced 
     *       with left subtree)
     *    3. interior node with only right subtree below it (node gets replaced
     *       with right subtree)
     *    4. interior node with both a left and right subtree below it. In this
     *       scenario, it gets the inorder successor node (aka, the smallest 
     *       value node in the right subtree, this is accomplished by using 
     *       method minValueNode()). Once found, it then copies the inorder
     *       successor node's value to this node, which for all purposes deletes 
     *       the node. Finally, it needs to delete that inorder successor node 
     *       from the right subtree.
     *
     *  When deleting a node, the heights need to be recalculated, including on 
     *  all ancestor nodes to the root. And for each node, if the bf is > 1, a 
     *  rotation is needed.
     *
     *  So, scenario 1 from above, we simply remove the leaf node and 
     *  recalculates the heights of each of its ancestors back to the root. 
     * 
     *  On scenarios 2 and 3, we simply pull up the appropriate subtree to 
     *  replace the deleted node and recalculate the height for this node and 
     *  each of its ancestors back to the root.
     *
     *  In scenario 4, the routine pulls up (and deletes) the "Inorder 
     *  Successor" node on its right subtree. It will be a leaf node. 
     * 
     *  This node (and its ancestors nodes) may need re-balancing; so the bf 
     *  is checked at the end of this routine and if needing re-balancing, it 
     *  invokes the proper rotation (LL, LR, RR, RL).
     *
     *  Again, the heights for each of its ancestor nodes are re-recalculate 
     *  to the root.
